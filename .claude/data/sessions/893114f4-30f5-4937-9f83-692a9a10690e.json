    "Review docs/ZAI-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md and create a detailed execution plan for implementing Z.ai integration into MAO. Then create specialized agents to execute each phase:\n\n1. Create a meta-agent to analyze the plan and break it into discrete tasks\n2. Create a research agent to verify Z.ai SDK compatibility and test basic connectivity  \n3. Create a development agent to implement the ZaiAgentClient wrapper\n4. Create a testing agent to validate the implementation\n5. Create a documentation agent to update all relevant docs\n\nAfter creating the agents, coordinate them to execute Phase 2 (Install & Test Z.ai SDK) from the integration plan. The goal is to:\n- Install zai-sdk package\n- Test basic connection with ZAI_API_KEY (Active key is in the .env file)\n- Verify API compatibility\n- Document any issues or blockers\n- Report findings\n\n\nUse the working directory: /Users/sem/mao-z\n\nStart by reading the integration plan, then create your execution strategy and agents.",

Catch race conditions, memory leaks, and security vulnerabilities without leaving your development environment.\n\n<Warning>The CodeRabbit CLI is in Beta.</Warning>\n\n## Review local changes\n\n<Info>\n  Looking for the full CodeRabbit experience? This page covers local CLI\n  reviews. For complete code reviews on pull requests, see\n  [Introduction](/overview/introduction).\n</Info>\n\nThe CodeRabbit CLI analyzes your uncommitted changes using the same pattern recognition that powers our PR reviews. Review code as you write it, apply suggested fixes instantly, and catch critical issues while you still have full context in memory.\n\nYou can get your code reviewed before you commit and get feedback immediately when the code is fresh in your mind.\n\n## Key features\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Review uncommitted changes\" icon=\"code\">\n    Analyze your working directory for race conditions, null pointer exceptions,\n    and logic errors before you commit.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"One-step fixes\" icon=\"wand-sparkles\">\n    Apply simple fixes like import corrections instantly. Hand complex\n    architectural issues to your AI agent with full context.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Context-aware reviews\" icon=\"brain\">\n    Paid users get reviews enhanced by learnings from your team's patterns -\n    remembers your error handling styles, architectural decisions, and coding\n    preferences.\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Detects coding agent files\" icon=\"folder-root\">\n    Automatically reads claude.md, .cursorrules, and custom team standards to\n    enforce your specific coding guidelines in every review.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## AI agent integration\n\nYou're already using CodeRabbit for PR reviews. With the CLI, you can now catch issues before you commit - reviewing uncommitted changes while the code is fresh in your mind. CodeRabbit detects the problems, then your AI coding agent implements the fixes.\n\n### Example prompt for your AI agent\n\nHere's a complete prompt you can use with Claude Code, Cursor, or other AI coding agents:\n\n```\nPlease implement phase 7.3 of the planning doc and then run coderabbit --prompt-only,\nlet it run as long as it needs (run it in the background) and fix any issues.\n```\n\n### Components of a good prompt\n\nBreaking down what makes an effective CodeRabbit + AI agent workflow:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Run CodeRabbit CLI\">\n    Tell your AI agent to run CodeRabbit with the `--prompt-only` flag:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    coderabbit --prompt-only\n    ```\n\n    You can also specify review types or branches:\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    # Review only uncommitted changes\n    coderabbit --prompt-only --type uncommitted\n\n    # With specific base branch\n    coderabbit --prompt-only --base develop\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Run in the background\">\n    CodeRabbit reviews can take 7-30+ minutes depending on the scope of changes. Instruct your AI agent to run CodeRabbit in the background and set up a timer to check periodically:\n\n    ```\n    Run coderabbit --prompt-only --type uncommitted in the background, let it take as long as it needs,\n    and check on it periodically.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Evaluate and implement fixes\">\n    Once CodeRabbit completes, have your AI agent evaluate the findings and prioritize:\n\n    ```\n    Evaluate the fixes and considerations. Fix major issues only, or fix any critical\n    issues and ignore the nits.\n    ```\n\n    This keeps your agent focused on meaningful improvements rather than minor style issues.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Verify with a second pass\">\n    Run CodeRabbit one more time to ensure fixes didn't introduce new issues:\n\n    ```\n    Once those changes are implemented, run CodeRabbit CLI one more time to make sure\n    we addressed all the critical issues and didn't introduce any additional bugs.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Set loop limits\">\n    Prevent infinite iteration by setting clear completion criteria:\n\n    ```\n    Only run the loop twice. If on the second run you don't find any critical issues,\n    ignore the nits and you're complete. Give me a summary of everything that was\n    completed and why.\n    ```\n\n    This ensures your AI agent completes the task efficiently and provides a clear report.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Integration guides\n\nSee detailed workflows for specific AI coding agents:\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Claude Code integration\" icon=\"robot\" href=\"/cli/claude-code-integration\">\n    Automated workflow with background execution and task-based fixes\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Codex integration\" icon=\"terminal\" href=\"/cli/codex-integration\">\n    Integrated code review and fix implementation with Codex CLI\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Pricing and capabilities\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Free tier\" icon=\"heart\">\n    Basic static analysis with limited daily usage.\n\n    * Catches syntax errors, obvious logic issues, and common security patterns.\n    * Perfect for individual developers trying out the CLI workflow.\n    * **Rate limit**: 1 review per hour\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Paid plans\" icon=\"crown\">\n    Enhanced reviews powered by learnings from your codebase history plus higher rate limits.\n\n    Paid users with linked GitHub accounts get:\n\n    * **Learnings-powered reviews**: Remembers your team's preferred patterns for error handling, state management, and architecture\n    * **Full contextual analysis**: Understands your imports, dependencies, and project structure\n    * **Team standards enforcement**: Applies your documented coding guidelines automatically\n    * **Advanced issue detection**: Spots subtle race conditions, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities\n    * **Rate limits**:\n      * Pro plan: 5 reviews per hour\n      * Lite plan: 1 review per hour\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n<Tip>\n  Paid users get nearly all PR review features in the CLI, including learnings\n  and contextual analysis.
