    "Start Phase 5 integration:\n\n1. Read agent_manager.py completely to understand the current implementation\n2. Design the provider factory pattern for dual-provider support\n3. Create ZaiAgentOptions class (pydantic model matching ClaudeAgentOptions structure)\n4. Implement the factory method that creates either ClaudeSDKClient or ZaiMaoClient based on provider\n5. Start modifying create_agent() method to support both providers\n\nDo NOT break the existing Claude SDK functionality. We need both providers working side-by-side.\n\nDocument your changes with comments explaining the dual-provider approach."
