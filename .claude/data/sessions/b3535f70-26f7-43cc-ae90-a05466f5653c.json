    "Start Phase 4 implementation:\n\n1. Create the ZaiToolsRegistry class structure\n2. Implement Priority 1 tools (Simple: Read, Write, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, TodoWrite, Bash)\n3. Write unit tests for each Priority 1 tool\n4. Ensure tools work with the hooks system (file tracking)\n\nFocus on getting the 7 Priority 1 tools working first. These are the most commonly used and critical for basic agent functionality.\n\nReference the Claude SDK behavior carefully to ensure exact compatibility.",
    "Continue with Phase 4 - Implement Priority 2 tools:\n\nPriority 2 (Medium Complexity):\n1. **Edit** - Modify file sections with exact string replacement (most important - heavily used)\n2. **BashOutput** - Run commands with background execution and output capture\n3. **AskUserQuestion** - Interactive prompts via WebSocket (lower priority, can defer)\n\nStart with the Edit tool as it's critical for agent functionality. Reference the Claude SDK Edit tool behavior:\n- Exact string replacement (old_string \u2192 new_string)\n- replace_all flag for multiple replacements\n- Must preserve exact indentation\n- Error if old_string not unique (unless replace_all=true)\n\nThen implement BashOutput for background command execution.\n\nCreate tests for each tool as you go."
